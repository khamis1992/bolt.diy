### Design Principles

Throughout the implementation, the following principles were maintained:

1. **Preserve Existing Design**: All new UI components use the existing bolt.diy design system
2. **Additive Integration**: No existing functionality was removed or broken
3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript coverage for all new code
4. **Security First**: RLS policies on all database tables
5. **Performance**: Optimized queries and batch operations
6. **Developer Experience**: Clear documentation and consistent patterns

### Migration Notes

#### For Existing Users
- Existing local projects are not automatically migrated
- Users need to create an account to use cloud features
- Local storage continues to work as before
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

#### For Developers
- New environment variables required (see `.env.example`)
- Supabase project must be configured
- OAuth providers need to be set up (optional)
- Storage buckets need to be created

### Known Limitations

1. **File Size**: Large binary files should use Supabase Storage (not implemented yet)
2. **Real-time Collaboration**: Not implemented (prepared for future)
3. **Subscription Billing**: Stripe integration not implemented
4. **API Rate Limiting**: Not implemented (should be added)
5. **Email Verification**: Uses Supabase default (can be customized)

### Future Enhancements

The following features are prepared but not yet implemented:

1. **Subscription System**: Stripe integration for paid plans
2. **Project Sharing**: Share projects with specific users
3. **Team Management**: Create and manage teams
4. **API Keys**: Generate keys for programmatic access
5. **Real-time Collaboration**: Live editing with other users
6. **Version Control**: Project version history
7. **Analytics Dashboard**: Detailed usage charts
8. **Notifications**: Email and in-app notifications
9. **Project Templates**: Save and share templates
10. **Webhooks**: Event notifications for integrations
